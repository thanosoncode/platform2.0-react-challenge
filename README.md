# GWI Challenge

## CatLover

I re-visited the Catlover challenge (that initially was part of my hiring process in gwi) six months after being working with the gwi team ðŸ¤˜&#10084; in order to further practice and see if anything changed <br /><br/>
I created the react project from scratch in order to learn working with Webpack, Babel and other different technologies that React uses.
